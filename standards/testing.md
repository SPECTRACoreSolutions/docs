# Testing Standards

Testing guidelines and best practices for SPECTRA.

## Default Approach: TDD

- Use pytest as the testing framework
- Write tests alongside or immediately after module development
- Focus on unit tests for core utilities, data processing, internal APIs
- Tests should cover functionality, edge cases, and error handling

## BDD for Critical Features

- Use pytest-bdd for behavior scenarios
- Apply to user-facing features
- Write tests in Given/When/Then format

## Documentation

See memory ID 11695605 for complete testing standards.
